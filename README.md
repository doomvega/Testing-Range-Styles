# Testing-Range-Styles

This is a Github repo for the various styles hosted on the Testing Range. I figured it would be easier to package them here. You should be able to drag and drop these into Neocities and Nekoweb. I'm not sure about other site hosts or services.

Because this is one repo for many styles, I recommend finding a way to download one folder from a GitHub repo. See this StackOverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7106012/download-a-single-folder-or-directory-from-a-github-repository

I personally use this Firefox extension for this: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gitzip/

This repo allows me to update my layouts in case something breaks, a weird use-case pops up, or I need to add something quickly. Make sure to check for any important updates for the style(s) you're using! They'll likely be CSS or JS updates.

# Important!

Please credit me somewhere on your site if you use my work. It means a lot to me. Let me know if you make a site with one of my layouts! I'd love to see. ðŸ¥°

Copied directly from the Testing Range: *"Once I make these, the content that people put on their websites is out of my hands; I'm not responsible for it. If they're hosting with Neocities or Nekoweb, report the website if it breaks their rules. As a general rule of thumb, I would appreciate if the sites people made with my work weren't bigoted or hate-filled. That's not why any of us should be making websites."*
