# Testing-Range-Styles

This is a Github repo for the various styles hosted on the Testing Range. I figured it would be easier to package them here. You should be able to drag and drop these into Neocities and Nekoweb. I'm not sure about other site hosts or services.

Because this is one repo for many styles, I recommend finding a way to download one folder from a GitHub repo. See this StackOverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7106012/download-a-single-folder-or-directory-from-a-github-repository
I personally use this Firefox extension for this: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gitzip/
