Hi, I'm DOOMVEGA. Thanks for using a style I wrote!

I've included some useful things to help you get set up with your new site.
(Congrats! Always good to see more websites! <3)

You should have an index.html file, a robots.txt file, a testingrange.html file,
and a CSS folder with base.css and topper.css inside.

!!! IMPORTANT STUFF !!!

For this style specifically, there are a few quirks you need to be aware of.
For example, if you'd like to mix the gallery with text (like putting a header
over the gallery or writing a small snippet above or below the gallery), you
need to make sure the gallery is outside of the "text" div.

Also, the CSS is fairly complex. I have left comments and a link to W3Schools,
but BE CAREFUL when you're styling!

index.html is the landing page for your site. Use it as a home page or a hub.

robots.txt tries to stop bots from scraping your site. Bots can deny this,
but it's worth a try, right?

testingrange.html is NOT NECESSARY, but I like to keep one around to test new
concepts, like a new style or div, before implementing it on the rest of the site.
You can delete it if you'd like.

base.css should be LEFT ALONE. This CSS allows the site to function. It defines
things like div widths, heights, flexbox stuff, and other really important stuff.

topper.css is FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE. This CSS defines things like color, shadows,
gradients, everything. It is a list of variables that are connected to base.css,
which will allow you to change the way your site looks without completely
breaking it.
